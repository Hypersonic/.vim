Josh's vimrc
------------

Just my vimrc, doesn't have much (by intention, my old one was HUUUUUUGE, so I needed to fix that).

Plugins
-------
- Pathogen (for loading plugins

Colorschemes
------------
- evening.vim, with a few tweaks (set to default in vimrc)
- smyck.vim

Curious things
--------------
- I've gotten into the odd habit of coding on an ssh'd iPad, but the keyboard doesn't have an escape key. I mapped `'''` to `<esc>` to compensate.
- I've mapped shift+[h/j/k/l] to [home/pgdown/pgup/end], since I find it useful.

Using
-----
- Feel free to use this, if you like it, I'd love some feedback!
